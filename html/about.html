      <p class="p-ab-2">
        he durian (/ˈdʊəriən/, /ˈdjʊəriən/)[2] is the edible fruit of several
        tree species belonging to the genus Durio. There are 30 recognized Durio
        species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit.[3][4] Durio
        zibethinus, native to Borneo and Sumatra, is the only species available
        on the international market. It has over 300 named varieties in Thailand
        and 100 in Malaysia as of 1987.[3] Other species are sold in their local
        regions.[3] Named in some regions as the "king of fruits",[4][5] the
        durian is distinctive for its large size, strong odour, and
        thorn-covered rind. The fruit can grow as large as 30 cm (12 in) long
        and 15 cm (5.9 in) in diameter, and it typically weighs 1 to 3 kg (2.2
        to 6.6 lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its
        husk from green to brown, and its flesh from pale yellow to red,
        depending on the species. Some people regard the durian as having a
        pleasantly sweet fragrance, whereas others find the aroma overpowering
        and unpleasant. The smell evokes reactions ranging from deep
        appreciation to intense disgust. The persistence of its odour, which may
        linger for several days, has led some hotels and public transportation
        services in Southeast Asia to ban the fruit. The flesh can be consumed
        at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavour a wide variety
        of savoury and sweet desserts in Southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can
        also be eaten when cooked. Etymology The name "durian" is derived from
        the Malay word duri (meaning 'thorn'), a reference to the numerous
        prickly thorns on its rind, combined with the noun-building suffix
        -an.[6][7] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the alternate
        spelling durion was first used in a 1588 translation of The History of
        the Great and Mighty Kingdom of China and the Situation Thereof by the
        Spanish explorer Juan González de Mendoza:[6] There is one, yt is called
        in the Malaca tongue Durion, and is so good that [...] it doth exceede
        in savour all others that euer they had seene, or tasted. Other
        historical variants include duryoen, duroyen, durean, and dorian.[6] The
        name of the type species, Durio zibethinus, is derived from Viverra
        zibetha (the large Indian civet), a mammal known for its odour.

      <p class="p-ab-2">
        Durian trees are large, growing to 25–50 metres (80–165 feet) in height
        depending on the species.[10] The leaves are evergreen, elliptic to
        oblong and 10–18 centimetres (4–7 inches) long. The flowers are produced
        in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on
        the trunk with each flower having a calyx (sepals) and five (rarely four
        or six) petals. Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting
        periods per year, although the timing varies depending on the species,
        cultivars, and localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after
        four or five years. The durian fruit can hang from any branch, and
        matures roughly three months after pollination. The fruit can grow up to
        30 cm (12 in) long and 15 cm (6 in) in diameter, and typically weighs
        one to three kilograms (2 to 7 lb).[10] Its shape ranges from oblong to
        round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow
        to red, depending on the species.[10] Among the thirty known species of
        Durio, nine of them have been identified as producing edible fruits: D.
        zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. grandiflorus, D. graveolens, D. kutejensis,
        Durio lowianus, D. macrantha, D. oxleyanus and D. testudinarius.[19] The
        fruit of many species has never been collected or properly examined,
        however, so other species may have edible fruit.[10] The durian is
        somewhat similar in appearance to the jackfruit, an unrelated species.

      <p class="p-ab-2">
        The tree has oblong tapering leaves, rounded at the base, and yellowish
        green flowers borne along the older branches. The fruit is spherical and
        15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 inches) in diameter. It has a hard external husk, or
        shell, covered with stout spines and contains five oval compartments,
        each filled with a cream-coloured pulp in which are embedded one to five
        chestnut-sized seeds. The ripe fruits are eaten by many animals and are
        an important part of local ecosystems.
